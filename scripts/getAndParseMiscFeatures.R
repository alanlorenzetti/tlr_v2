# description ####
# this script will get/load
# a few additional misc features
# LSm binding sites
# UTR info
# GC content

# processing starts ####
# getting and parsing LSm binding info
# here I will load the table, remove the asRNAs
# and lookup into genes and 5UTRs
# if LSm binding sites are detected
# in genes or 5UTRs, sense or antisense,
# that will be taken into consideration
